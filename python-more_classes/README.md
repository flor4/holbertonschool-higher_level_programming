# üì¶ Python - More Classes and Objects

This project is part of a deeper dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. It builds on the basics and covers advanced concepts like class vs instance attributes, static and class methods, data abstraction, and more ‚Äî all implemented through a set of exercises focused on building and managing a `Rectangle` class.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will understand:

* Why Python is considered an **awesome programming language**
* The fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python
* The concept of "**first-class everything**" in Python
* What are **classes**, **objects**, and **instances**
* The difference between a **class** and an **object**
* **Attributes**: public, protected, and private
* The role of `self` in class methods
* What methods are, especially special methods like:

  * `__init__`
  * `__str__`
  * `__repr__`
* Concepts such as:

  * **Data Abstraction**
  * **Data Encapsulation**
  * **Information Hiding**
* How to use **properties** and the Pythonic way to write **getters and setters**
* The difference between **object attributes** and **class attributes**
* How to use:

  * **Class methods**
  * **Static methods**
  * `getattr()` function
* How Python finds and manages object/class attributes using `__dict__`
* How to dynamically add attributes to instances or classes
