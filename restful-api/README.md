# 🌐 RESTful APIs - Concepts & Implementation

## 📖 Introduction

In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of **RESTful APIs**, a cornerstone in the realm of web services.

The **Representational State Transfer (REST)** architecture is a set of constraints that ensure scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication. It allows seamless integration of web services, making them accessible across diverse platforms and applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### ✅ HTTP/HTTPS Basics
- Understand how data is transferred over the web.
- Learn about HTTP methods and the distinction between HTTP and HTTPS.

### ✅ API Consumption with Command Line
- Use basic CLI tools (like `curl`, `httpie`) to interact with APIs.

### ✅ API Consumption with Python
- Fetch and manipulate API data using Python’s standard and external libraries (e.g. `requests`).

### ✅ API Development with `http.server`
- Create simple APIs using Python’s built-in `http.server` module.

### ✅ API Development with Flask
- Develop RESTful APIs using the **Flask** microframework.
- Implement routes, process data, and manage responses.

### ✅ API Security & Authentication
- Implement API key-based or token-based authentication.
- Learn about HTTPS, headers, and best practices for securing endpoints.

### ✅ API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI
- Write and generate standardized API documentation using **OpenAPI (Swagger)**.
- Understand how good documentation improves collaboration and usability.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

In today's interconnected digital world, RESTful APIs are everywhere:

- They bridge communication between different software systems.
- Enable automation, data exchange, and third-party integrations.
- Power features in web apps, mobile apps, IoT, cloud platforms, and more.

Mastering REST APIs means being able to **develop, consume, secure**, and **document** efficient communication layers — a vital skill for any developer or engineer.

### 🔄 Components & Flow

- **Client**: Initiates the request (e.g. web browser, mobile app, script).
- **Web Server**: Receives the request and routes it accordingly.
- **API Server**: Processes the logic, queries databases, and formats responses.
- **Database**: Stores the persistent data used and modified by the API.

#### 🔁 Request/Response Flow:

1. **Client** sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the **Web Server**.
2. **Web Server** forwards the request to the **API Server**.
3. **API Server** processes the logic and interacts with the **Database**.
4. The **API Server** returns a response to the **Web Server**.
5. **Web Server** delivers the response to the **Client**.

> In smaller applications, the Web Server and API Server may be merged.
